In this Project I tried to identify any organisation and propose possible weaknesses that may occur in the organization.
After identifying possible weaknesses carry out auditing project.
I also illustrate how an attacker my use use these weaknesses to conduct attack.
Identify control mechanisms the organisation is adopting to mitigate risks and suggest other controls the organisation may adopt.
If incidents actually happened suggest procedures the organisation should carry out to solve the problem and fecover from the incident.
